# Research
This repository contains the official implementation and evaluation toolkit for our research on benchmarking PDF chunking strategies: "Benchmarking Learning-Based and Rule-Based Chunking Methods and Constructing a Mature Industrial Data-Preprocessing Pipeline." Our work systematically compares rule-based (PyMuPDF) and learning-based (LayoutParser, Faster-RCNN) approaches for segmenting complex PDF documents into semantically meaningful chunks, preserving both structure and context. Designed for knowledge-intensive AI workflows—such as retrieval-augmented generation and LLM fine-tuning—the pipeline outputs structured JSON, applies robust evaluation metrics, and prepares content for downstream processing (including tokenization and chunking for transformer models). By providing reproducible, domain-robust benchmarks and an extensible pipeline, this project enables scalable, high-quality data preparation for next-generation AI applications.
